Multilingual content management and translation plugin allowing for a number of languages to be set up and used in a single site.

With Multilang you can set up many different language 'channels' and relevant translations against your default language. Easily switch between
different languages and allow user specific or automatic language selections.

== Installation ==

1. Upload all files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Set the default language and any other languages for translations.
4. Setup a translation by providing a unique key to reference each one, with the appropriate translations for each language.
5. Select the language translations to be used across the site in the dropdown box. 
4. Translations can then be referenced in the theme using [code]echo multilang('key');[/code], or can be used in the content with the shortcode [code][multilang key="key"][/code].
